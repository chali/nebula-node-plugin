# Gradle Plugin for Node


This plugin enabled you to use a lot of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)-based technologies as part of your
build without having NodeJS installed locally on your system. It integrates the following NodeJS-based system
with Gradle:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)

It's actually 3 plugins in one:

* [Node Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/nebula.node) (`nebula.node`) - [See docs](docs/node.md).
* [Grunt Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/nebula.grunt) (`nebula.grunt`) - [See docs](docs/grunt.md)
* [Gulp Plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/nebula.gulp) (`nebula.gulp`) - [See docs](docs/gulp.md)
